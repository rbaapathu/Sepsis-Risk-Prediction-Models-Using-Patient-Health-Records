# Sepsis-Risk-Prediction-Models-Using-Patient-Health-Records
Sepsis is a severe and life-threatening condition triggered by the body’s dysregulated immune response to infection, which can lead to organ dysfunction and high mortality rates. Timely recognition and treatment of sepsis are crucial to improving survival outcomes.
 Timely recognition and treatment of sepsis are crucial to improving survival outcomes. 
 In critical care settings, large amounts of patient data including vital signs, laboratory results, comorbidities, and demographics are collected. 
 Machine learning offers the opportunity to leverage this data for the early prediction of sepsis, potentially enabling proactive interventions and reducing healthcare burdens.
 This project utilizes a synthetic clinical dataset containing demographic, vital, and laboratory measurements to develop predictive models for sepsis. 
 The goal is to identify risk factors and build a reliable classification model that distinguishes sepsis cases from non-sepsis cases, aiding in early detection.
 Source: Synthetic Clinical Dataset (generated for academic and research use)Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/synthetic-clinical-tabular-dataset?resource=download   Number of Records: 10,000Number of Features: 14
Description:This dataset contains synthetic patient-level clinical records, including demographics, vital signs, laboratory test results, comorbidities, and outcomes. It is designed to study the onset and prediction of sepsis and related outcomes such as readmission and mortality. The data reflects real-world healthcare settings and provides a foundation for training and evaluating machine learning models for early sepsis detection.
Features: 
Vital signs: Systolic Blood Pressure, Diastolic Blood Pressure
Laboratory results: Glucose, Cholesterol, Creatinine
Demographics: Age, Sex, Body Mass Index (BMI)
Comorbidities: Diabetes, Hypertension
Outcomes: Diagnosis (Normal, Sepsis, Heart Failure, etc.), 30-day  Readmission, Mortality
Target Variable:
Diagnosis (with focus on identifying Sepsis cases)
Objective:The primary goal is to use patient demographics, vital signs, laboratory values, and comorbidities to enable the early detection of sepsis in clinical patients. By applying machine learning methods to this dataset, the project aims to support timely interventions, improve patient management, and reduce sepsis-related mortality.
